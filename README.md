# Smart Property-Based Land Registration System

## Overview

**Smart-Contract-Based-Registration** is a decentralized platform for managing property transactions securely using blockchain technology. It ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency in land registration, verification, and ownership transfer processes. By integrating smart contracts, the platform eliminates paperwork, reduces fraud, and facilitates smooth property exchanges.

## Features

### Registration
- **User Registration**: Buyer and seller accounts with verification by a land inspector (admin) or government authority.
- **Land Inspector Dashboard**: Verifies users and land details.
- **Notifications**: Real-time updates on the status of applications via APIs.

### Land Ownership Transfer
- **Transfer Process**: Securely managed by the land inspector.
- **Document Upload**: Legal documents stored securely using IPFS and blockchain.

### Dashboards
- **Seller Dashboard**:
  - Add and manage land listings.
  - Approve purchase requests.
- **Buyer Dashboard**:
  - Browse and request land purchases.
  - View and manage owned properties.

### Blockchain-Powered Transactions
- **Immutability**: Ensures secure, tamper-proof records.
- **Transparency**: Public ledger reduces fraud risks.
- **Digital Signing**: Facilitates secure title transfers with cryptocurrency payments.

### Additional Features
- **Legal Document Generation**: Buyers can download PDFs of legal documents after transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates workflows, including payment processing and record updates.
- **Notifications**: Email alerts for key events, such as offline meetings or approvals.

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js/Ethers.js
